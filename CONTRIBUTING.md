## Before you start

- Search existing issues/PRs to avoid duplicates.
- If you plan a large change, open an issue first to align on approach.

2. Make focused, incremental commits.
3. Update docs or comments when behavior changes.
4. Run any relevant checks/tests (see `scripts/` if available).

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs small and scoped to one change.
