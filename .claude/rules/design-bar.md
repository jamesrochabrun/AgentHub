# Steve Jobs Design Bar

Every UI change must meet this bar. No exceptions.

## The Five Checks

### 1. Ruthless Simplicity
- Nothing removable without losing meaning
- Every element earns its place
- If in doubt, remove it

### 2. One Clear Primary Action
- Each screen/component has ONE obvious next step
- Secondary actions are visually subordinate
- User never confused about what to do

### 3. Strong Visual Hierarchy
- Important things stand out
- Clear reading order
- Whitespace guides the eye

### 4. No Clutter
- Whitespace is a feature, not waste
- Breathing room between elements
- Clean, focused interfaces

### 5. Native macOS Feel
- Follows Apple HIG patterns
- Uses system colors and typography
- Feels at home on macOS

## Verdict

**Only two options:**
- SHIP YES - Meets all five checks
- SHIP NO - Fails one or more checks

No middle ground. No "good enough."

## Review Process

1. ui-polish receives UI for review
2. Evaluates against all five checks
3. Issues verdict with reasoning
4. If SHIP NO, provides specific changes needed
5. Re-review after changes

## Common Failures

### Too Much
- Too many buttons
- Too many options
- Too much text
- Too many colors

### Poor Hierarchy
- Everything same visual weight
- Primary action not obvious
- Competing focal points

### Not Native
- Custom controls when system works
- Wrong typography
- Non-standard patterns

## Examples

### SHIP YES
- Clear, focused interface
- Obvious primary action
- Native macOS appearance
- Appropriate whitespace

### SHIP NO
- Cluttered controls
- Unclear what to do next
- Custom styling that feels foreign
- Cramped layout
